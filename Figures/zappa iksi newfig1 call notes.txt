try making dS/dt a line instead of a filled thing.
keep a label on the y-axis for flow, and put the annotation on the other side.
Label it NE current speed. 
Label it Water Temperature

Minimize text annotations - move to the caption ("negative values" and "shaded regions")

Make a single dT-S plot that shows the two main slopes
(sal varies independently, vs. sal & T move together)

make dT the same color in middle and bottom panels
Add line to dT-S plot showing slope for constant temp?


Need to make supplementary material showing salinity adjustment for stratified cases??
